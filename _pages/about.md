# About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate studying urban feedbacks on extreme weather. I am researching on the effect of urban resilience enhancing strategies on modulating extreme rainfall in Houston, supported by the Future Investigator in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) since 2020. The projects that I am working on includes:
  1. The importance of detail urban characterization in simulating extreme rainfall.
  2. The impact of urbanization on tornados.
  3. The effect of urban resilience enhancing strategies on Houston extreme rainfall.
